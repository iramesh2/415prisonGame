# Unreal Complex AI Models

## Overview
Unreal Complex AI Models is a collection of advanced AI behaviors and systems designed for the Unreal Engine 4. This project provides a robust framework for creating complex enemy AI with versatile capabilities, suitable for a wide range of games and simulations. Developers can leverage these models to create challenging and intelligent enemies that can adapt and react to player actions in real-time.

## AI Features
- **Sentry Detection**: AI can keep watch and detect the player based on sight and sound, triggering alerts or direct engagement.
- **Intelligent Chasing**: Once the player is detected, the AI can pursue with smart pathfinding algorithms that adapt to the environment and player's actions.
- **Player Location Prediction**: AI can predict the player's future position to effectively use missiles or other targeted attacks.
- **Teleportation**: For games that require a supernatural element, some AI models can teleport, adding an unpredictable challenge.
- **Smart Coordination**: AI can communicate and coordinate with other AI entities to strategically corner or ambush the player.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The AI can operate at various levels of complexity, from simple patrolling behaviors to advanced tactical decision-making.

## Player Mechanics
- **Dash and Skill Mechanisms**: The project includes player mechanics such as dashing and other skills to evade and counteract AI strategies.

## Installation & Setup
Follow these instructions to implement the AI models into your Unreal Engine 4 project:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/unreal-complex-ai-models.git
   cd unreal-complex-ai-models

2. **Integrate AI Models**
- Import the AI model files into your existing Unreal Engine project's Content folder.
- Configure the AI parameters within your project's AI controller, pawn, or character blueprints as needed.
3. **Customize AI Behavior**
- Use the provided behavior trees and blackboard assets to customize the AI's decision-making processes.
- Adapt the sensory components and variables to fit the design of your game's levels and player mechanics.
Usage

The AI models are designed to be drag-and-drop ready for most Unreal Engine 4 projects.
Detailed comments are provided within the blueprints and scripts to guide you through customization and integration.
Sample levels are provided to demonstrate the AI in action and to serve as testing grounds for your configurations.
